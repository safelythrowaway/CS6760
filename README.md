# CS6760
Repo for the modeling Biological Networks course


In order to run the code simply clone the repo or copy the two python files to your favorite environment.

In order to run the test simpy run the test.py script (after making sure all of the required packages are installed).
The test.py script contains all of the information to test the code using a insert and plasmid from synbiohub.org.
You should be able to place the web address of any synbiohub.org part and plasmid into the test.py script.

If your plasmid doesn't have the requred restriction sites, there will be a print statement that shows which sites were
detected and then an error will be thrown.  This is something that still needs to be fixed.

There will be an output csv generated which will have the data of interest in it.  It will be placed in the folder where the two scripts are located.

Have fun!
